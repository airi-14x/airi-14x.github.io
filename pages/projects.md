- The tokens needed to be sorted and the duplicate terms needs to be merged. This resulted in have a merged posting list that has to be sorted again.
- The queries were passed as a parameter and used to look up the term in the index.
- As for creating a compressed index, the numbers were removed, it was case-folded and the stopwords were removed.
- Technologies: Python, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, JSON

#### [Project #3 - Created an index via SPIMI](https://github.com/airi-14x/COMP479-Information-Retrieval/tree/master/Project3)
