### COMP 479 - Projects
#### [Project #1 - NLTK, Cleaning and Parsing the Reuters Collection](https://github.com/airi-14x/COMP479-Information-Retrieval/tree/master/Project1)
- Used NLTK library, and BeautifulSoup to parse Reuters collection into documents, articles, tokens, stems. Also, removed stopwords indexed in indexer.
- Used two methods to create the indexer:
	- Pipelining from block 1 to block 6
	- Feeding input one block at a time.
- Technologies: Python, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, JSON

#### [Project #2 - Create an Indexer, a Single Term Querying Processor and a Compressed Index](https://github.com/airi-14x/COMP479-Information-Retrieval/tree/master/Project2)
- The tokens needed to be sorted and the duplicate terms needs to be merged. This resulted in have a merged posting list that has to be sorted again.
- The queries were passed as a parameter and used to look up the term in the index.
- As for creating a compressed index, the numbers were removed, it was case-folded and the stopwords were removed.
- Technologies: Python, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, JSON

#### [Project #3 - Created an index via SPIMI](https://github.com/airi-14x/COMP479-Information-Retrieval/tree/master/Project3)
- Single term querying processor and OR query processor was implemented. 
- Partially implemented: AND query processor.
- Due to lack of time as well as having surgery, ranking was not implemented and the AND query processor.
